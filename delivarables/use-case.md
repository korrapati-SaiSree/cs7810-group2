# Narrative
Despite improvements in infrastructure, safety rules, and technology, road incidents continue to result in millions of injuries and over 1.35 million fatalities annually, posing a multifaceted and complex global issue. An in-depth examination of the complex interactions between variables such driver behaviour, vehicle condition, road infrastructure, weather, and socioeconomic impacts is necessary to comprehend and prevent traffic accidents. A knowledge graph (KG), which enables the modelling of interactions between different aspects and offers a rich, interconnected dataset for deeper insights, can better handle this complexity.

The goal of the road crash knowledge graph is to provide data-driven insights into accident causes, patterns, and risk prediction to public safety agencies, insurance companies, autonomous vehicle developers, and politicians. Nevertheless, based on the integration of the dataset and local requirements, the reach may be broadened either nationally or internationally.

The KG will simulate intricate relationships between several crash-related variables, including:

1) Conditions for the driver: looking at issues like weariness, alcohol or drug use, distractions (such using a phone while driving), and how these factors interact with other elements like the time of day or the weather.
2) Vehicle Conditions: Being aware of how poorly maintained vehicles, such as those with old tires, malfunctioning brakes, or antiquated safety equipment, can increase the risk of collisions, particularly when paired with certain types of roads or unfavourable weather.
3) Road Conditions: This includes traffic density, signage clarity, maintenance standards, road design (e.g., abrupt curves, poor lighting), and how these elements differ in urban, suburban, and rural environments.
4) Weather Conditions: Examining how various weather patterns—such as snow, rain, fog, or intense heat—increase the likelihood of accidents and how these impacts vary with the season and the location.
5) Socioeconomic and Demographic Factors: Examining the associations between higher crash frequency and neighbourhood wealth, infrastructure investment, driver age, and educational attainment, providing information on socioeconomic differences in road safety.

The knowledge graph uncovers hidden interactions between these various components, going beyond basic causal correlations. For instance, how do inclement weather and inadequate lighting enhance the chance of a nighttime collision? How do driver fatigue and poorly maintained cars increase the likelihood of an accident? In order to spot trends, such as whether more accidents happen in the summer because of greater travel or in the winter because of snow and ice, the KG can also take seasonal data into account.

This KG is dynamic due to the addition of temporal dimensions, which enable analysis according to time periods (e.g., weekends, vacations, rush hours) or seasonality (e.g., winter accidents versus summer accidents). This time-based analysis aids in determining when preventive actions have to be intensified, such as concentrating on road upkeep prior to winter or stepping up awareness campaigns during the busiest travel times.

This knowledge graph is also special because it can simulate interactions between different road kinds and geographies, such as low-traffic country highways, suburban roadways, and high-density urban areas. Local policy actions can be guided by knowledge of how accidents differ geographically and the reasons that are most common in these places (e.g., speeding in rural areas, distracted driving in urban settings).

Finally, the knowledge graph will assist in locating regions with greater crash rates due to socioeconomic reasons. Lower-income neighbourhoods, for instance, may have poorly maintained roads, inadequate infrastructure for safety, or less accessible driving education programs. It is possible to customise policy recommendations to lessen inequity in road safety by analysing these patterns.

A thorough, scalable, and adaptable method is offered by the knowledge graph, which enables stakeholders to query the data for particular insights. It offers multi-layered, interwoven linkages between different crash-related factors, which sets it unique from standard relational databases. In the end, our method will assist in recognising patterns, projecting future regions of high risk, and providing practical advice for prevention—all the while adjusting to new data sources and use cases.


#  Competency Questions
1. What combination of environmental factors (such as weather conditions, lighting, and time of day) and driver impairments is most frequently associated with fatal collisions across the U.S.?
2. How do the probabilities of multivehicle collisions vary in specific road scenarios, such as limited visibility or construction zones, based on historical data from diverse regions in the U.S.?
3. How does vehicle type (e.g., truck, sedan, motorcycle) influence the likelihood of accidents and severity of injuries or fatalities, and how do specific driving maneuvers (e.g., lane changes, speeding) or equipment malfunctions affect these outcomes? Additionally, to what extent do safety features (such as seat belts, airbags) mitigate these risks?
4. What impact do driver characteristics (such as age, past infractions, underage or illegal driving, and experience with the vehicle) have on the likelihood of causing accidents that result in injuries or fatalities?
5. What have been the top 5 most frequent causes of distracted driving-related car accidents during rush hour across the U.S. in the past 12 months?
6. Which U.S. regions experience the greatest number of accidents during winter snowstorms, and what types of vehicles are most often involved in these collisions?
7. How do socioeconomic factors (such as income levels and access to public transportation) influence crash rates in various regions across the U.S., particularly in relation to accident severity?
8. What are the temporal patterns of accident occurrences across various U.S. regions, particularly during high-traffic periods like holidays or in areas undergoing major road construction?
9. How do accident rates differ between regions (urban, rural, high-traffic, low-traffic), and what geographic factors are associated with consistently higher rates of severe accidents?
10. What relationship exists between a driver’s prior crash history and their likelihood of being involved in subsequent high-risk incidents, particularly in cases of impaired driving or speeding?
11. How have changes in traffic safety regulations (e.g., DUI thresholds, seatbelt laws) affected trends in crash frequency and severity across different U.S. states or regions?
12. How do animal crossings (e.g., deer, elk) influence accident rates in rural and suburban areas, and what measures have been most effective in mitigating these collisions?
