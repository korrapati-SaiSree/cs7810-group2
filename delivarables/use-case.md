# Narrative
With over 1.35 million deaths and countless injuries annually, road crashes have been one of the most critical global concerns that bring financial and psychological hardship. Road accidents continue to happen due to the complex interaction of factors such as driver behavior, environmental circumstances, and socioeconomic inequality, even with technical breakthroughs in vehicles and infrastructure. A Knowledge Graph (KG) can be a game-changer in addressing these problems since it captures the interactions between various factors in a sophisticated and integrated manner.

By offering a structured, semantic framework for crash data analysis, the Road Crashes Knowledge Graph seeks to assist stakeholders including emergency responders, urban planners, transportation agencies, researchers, and insurance. The KG helps stakeholders find trends and obtain useful insights by displaying things like drivers, road conditions, weather, and socioeconomic aspects, as well as the connections between them. For instance, it can show how socioeconomic inequality affects crash frequency or how weather and EMS response times affect survival rates.

Unlike other conventional relational databases, a KG can easily represent and query complex relationships. A KG represents the dynamic, interconnected character of crash data, whereas tabular data models are limited to static and linear representations. Its powerful querying capabilities enable the detection of hidden patterns and trends, while its schema-less structure lets it adapt to new kinds of data and relationships as they develop. Due to this, it can be considered the ideal tool to address the complex nature of road traffic accidents and design effective treatments.

Because it incorporates elements that are frequently disregarded in current models, such as inadequate road maintenance, socioeconomic circumstances, and driver distractions, this initiative is both innovative and timely. The KG offers a thorough viewpoint by integrating these less obvious reasons with more conventional elements like the weather and vehicle conditions. This all-encompassing strategy might greatly improve road safety programs, lower the number of fatalities, and guide the development of life-saving and transportation-improving laws globally.










#  Competency Questions
1. How do different types of collisions (like head-on or rear-end) and seat positions affect fatality rates?
2. What patterns can be seen between weather conditions, seasons, and the chances of fatalities in crashes?
3. How do EMS response times (from being notified to arriving at the crash site and transporting to a hospital) affect survival rates?
4. How does driver impairment (from alcohol, drugs, or fatigue) impact crash rates?
5. ---------
6. How do a driver's license status and type relate to the rate of crashes?
7. How do specific road conditions affect the likelihood and severity of crashes?
8. How do a state's socio-economic conditions influence crash rates?
9. ----------
10. ---------
