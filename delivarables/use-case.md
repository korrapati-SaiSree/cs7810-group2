# Narrative
With over 1.35 million deaths and countless injuries annually, road crashes have been one of the most critical global concerns that bring financial and psychological hardship. Road accidents continue to happen due to the complex interaction of factors such as driver behavior, environmental circumstances, and socioeconomic inequality, even with technical breakthroughs in vehicles and infrastructure. A Knowledge Graph (KG) can be a game-changer in addressing these problems since it captures the interactions between various factors in a sophisticated and integrated manner.

By offering a structured, semantic framework for crash data analysis, the Road Crashes Knowledge Graph seeks to assist stakeholders including emergency responders, urban planners, transportation agencies, researchers, and insurance. The KG helps stakeholders find trends and obtain useful insights by displaying things like drivers, road conditions, weather, and socioeconomic aspects, as well as the connections between them. For instance, it can show how socioeconomic inequality affects crash frequency or how weather and EMS response times affect survival rates.

Unlike other conventional relational databases, a KG can easily represent and query complex relationships. A KG represents the dynamic, interconnected character of crash data, whereas tabular data models are limited to static and linear representations. Its powerful querying capabilities enable the detection of hidden patterns and trends, while its schema-less structure lets it adapt to new kinds of data and relationships as they develop. Due to this, it can be considered the ideal tool to address the complex nature of road traffic accidents and design effective treatments.

Because it incorporates elements that are frequently disregarded in current models, such as inadequate road maintenance, socioeconomic circumstances, and driver distractions, this initiative is both innovative and timely. The KG offers a thorough viewpoint by integrating these less obvious reasons with more conventional elements like the weather and vehicle conditions. This all-encompassing strategy might greatly improve road safety programs, lower the number of fatalities, and guide the development of life-saving and transportation-improving laws globally.










#  Competency Questions
1. What combination of environmental factors (such as weather conditions, lighting, and time of day) and driver impairments is most frequently associated with fatal collisions across the U.S.?
2. How do the probabilities of multivehicle collisions vary in specific road scenarios, such as limited visibility or construction zones, based on historical data from diverse regions in the U.S.?
3. How does vehicle type (e.g., truck, sedan, motorcycle) influence the likelihood of accidents and severity of injuries or fatalities, and how do specific driving maneuvers (e.g., lane changes, speeding) or equipment malfunctions affect these outcomes? Additionally, to what extent do safety features (such as seat belts, airbags) mitigate these risks?
4. What impact do driver characteristics (such as age, past infractions, underage or illegal driving, and experience with the vehicle) have on the likelihood of causing accidents that result in injuries or fatalities?
5. What have been the top 5 most frequent causes of distracted driving-related car accidents during rush hour across the U.S. in the past 12 months?
6. Which U.S. regions experience the greatest number of accidents during winter snowstorms, and what types of vehicles are most often involved in these collisions?
7. How do socioeconomic factors (such as income levels and access to public transportation) influence crash rates in various regions across the U.S., particularly in relation to accident severity?
8. What are the temporal patterns of accident occurrences across various U.S. regions, particularly during high-traffic periods like holidays or in areas undergoing major road construction?
9. How do accident rates differ between regions (urban, rural, high-traffic, low-traffic), and what geographic factors are associated with consistently higher rates of severe accidents?
10. What relationship exists between a driverâ€™s prior crash history and their likelihood of being involved in subsequent high-risk incidents, particularly in cases of impaired driving or speeding?
11. How have changes in traffic safety regulations (e.g., DUI thresholds, seatbelt laws) affected trends in crash frequency and severity across different U.S. states or regions?
12. How do animal crossings (e.g., deer, elk) influence accident rates in rural and suburban areas, and what measures have been most effective in mitigating these collisions?
