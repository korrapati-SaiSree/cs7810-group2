# Narrative
Despite improvements in infrastructure, safety rules, and technology, road incidents continue to result in millions of injuries and over 1.35 million fatalities annually, posing a multifaceted and complex global issue. An in-depth examination of the complex interactions between variables such driver behaviour, vehicle condition, road infrastructure, weather, and socioeconomic impacts is necessary to comprehend and prevent traffic accidents. A knowledge graph (KG), which enables the modelling of interactions between different aspects and offers a rich, interconnected dataset for deeper insights, can better handle this complexity.

The goal of the road crash knowledge graph is to provide data-driven insights into accident causes, patterns, and risk prediction to public safety agencies, insurance companies, autonomous vehicle developers, and politicians. Because of its varied weather patterns and combination of urban and rural road types, Ohio serves as a particular pilot for our focus on the United States. Nevertheless, based on the integration of the dataset and local requirements, the reach may be broadened either nationally or internationally.

The KG will simulate intricate relationships between several crash-related variables, including:

1) Conditions for the driver: looking at issues like weariness, alcohol or drug use, distractions (such using a phone while driving), and how these factors interact with other elements like the time of day or the weather.
2) Vehicle Conditions: Being aware of how poorly maintained vehicles, such as those with old tires, malfunctioning brakes, or antiquated safety equipment, can increase the risk of collisions, particularly when paired with certain types of roads or unfavourable weather.
3) Road Conditions: This includes traffic density, signage clarity, maintenance standards, road design (e.g., abrupt curves, poor lighting), and how these elements differ in urban, suburban, and rural environments.
4) Weather Conditions: Examining how various weather patterns—such as snow, rain, fog, or intense heat—increase the likelihood of accidents and how these impacts vary with the season and the location.
5) Socioeconomic and Demographic Factors: Examining the associations between higher crash frequency and neighbourhood wealth, infrastructure investment, driver age, and educational attainment, providing information on socioeconomic differences in road safety.

The knowledge graph uncovers hidden interactions between these various components, going beyond basic causal correlations. For instance, how do inclement weather and inadequate lighting enhance the chance of a nighttime collision? How do driver fatigue and poorly maintained cars increase the likelihood of an accident? In order to spot trends, such as whether more accidents happen in the summer because of greater travel or in the winter because of snow and ice, the KG can also take seasonal data into account.

This KG is dynamic due to the addition of temporal dimensions, which enable analysis according to time periods (e.g., weekends, vacations, rush hours) or seasonality (e.g., winter accidents versus summer accidents). This time-based analysis aids in determining when preventive actions have to be intensified, such as concentrating on road upkeep prior to winter or stepping up awareness campaigns during the busiest travel times.

This knowledge graph is also special because it can simulate interactions between different road kinds and geographies, such as low-traffic country highways, suburban roadways, and high-density urban areas. Local policy actions can be guided by knowledge of how accidents differ geographically and the reasons that are most common in these places (e.g., speeding in rural areas, distracted driving in urban settings).

Finally, the knowledge graph will assist in locating regions with greater crash rates due to socioeconomic reasons. Lower-income neighbourhoods, for instance, may have poorly maintained roads, inadequate infrastructure for safety, or less accessible driving education programs. It is possible to customise policy recommendations to lessen inequity in road safety by analysing these patterns.

A thorough, scalable, and adaptable method is offered by the knowledge graph, which enables stakeholders to query the data for particular insights. It offers multi-layered, interwoven linkages between different crash-related factors, which sets it unique from standard relational databases. In the end, our method will assist in recognising patterns, projecting future regions of high risk, and providing practical advice for prevention—all the while adjusting to new data sources and use cases.


#  Competency Questions
1. What have been the top 5 most frequent reasons for distracted driving-related car accidents in Ohio during rush hour during the past 12 months?
2. Which Ohio regions have the greatest accidents during winter snowstorms, and what aspects of vehicles are most often involved in these collisions?
3. What is the relationship between crash rates in Ohio's various counties and socioeconomic factors like income levels and availability to public transportation?
4. Which three types of road conditions—potholes, dimly lighted roads, etc.—are most frequently linked to crashes that occur at night in Ohio's rural areas during the winter?
5. What factors, such as rain, snow, or fog, along with poorly maintained cars (tires that are too old or brakes that aren't working properly) raise the danger of crashes on Ohio's suburban roads?
6. What season (time of year) sees the most accidents in Ohio involving young drivers (those between the ages of 16 and 24) and what are the most frequent contributing factors?
7. Which five factors account for the majority of crashes that occur on Ohio's highways during periods of high traffic (like the holidays)?
8. Which Ohio counties have the highest frequency of sleep-deprived driving accidents, and how does this change with the kind of road and time of day?
9. Which Ohio locations have the highest frequency of accidents brought on by badly maintained roads (potholes, missing signage, etc.), and how do these accidents differ across rural and urban areas?
10. How likely is it that accidents will rise in Ohio's urban regions when inclement weather, distracted driving, and poor road maintenance occur, and how does this relate to rural areas?
