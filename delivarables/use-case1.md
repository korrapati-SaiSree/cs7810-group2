# Narrative
Nevertheless, the advancements that have taken place include infrastructure, safety rules, and technology it is a proven fact that road incidents are still causing millions of injuries and over 1.35 million fatalities throughout the world, which can be considered as a global and complex problem. It is therefore important at this juncture to understand explicitly, the relations of couplings between parameters like driver behavior, condition of the vehicles on the roads, road infrastructure, weather conditions, and socioeconomic effects in order to study and avert traffic accidents. For this complexity, there is need to use the knowledge graph (KG) that allows for representation of relations between different aspects and possesses a large interconnected data set for further analysis.
The goal of the road crash knowledge graph is to provide data-driven insights into accident causes, patterns, and risk prediction to public safety agencies, insurance companies, autonomous vehicle developers, and politicians. Nevertheless, based on the integration of the dataset and local requirements, the reach may be broadened either nationally or internationally.

The KG will simulate intricate relationships between several crash-related variables, including:

1) Conditions for the driver: looking at issues like weariness, alcohol or drug use, distractions (such using a phone while driving), and how these factors interact with other elements like the time of day or the weather.
2) Vehicle Conditions: Being aware of how poorly maintained vehicles, such as those with old tires, malfunctioning brakes, or antiquated safety equipment, can increase the risk of collisions, particularly when paired with certain types of roads or unfavourable weather.
3) Road Conditions: This includes traffic density, signage clarity, maintenance standards, road design (e.g., abrupt curves, poor lighting), and how these elements differ in urban, suburban, and rural environments.
4) Weather Conditions: Examining how various weather patterns—such as snow, rain, fog, or intense heat—increase the likelihood of accidents and how these impacts vary with the season and the location.
5) Socioeconomic and Demographic Factors: Examining the associations between higher crash frequency and neighbourhood wealth, infrastructure investment, driver age, and educational attainment, providing information on socioeconomic differences in road safety.

The knowledge graph uncovers hidden interactions between these various components, going beyond basic causal correlations. For instance, how do inclement weather and inadequate lighting enhance the chance of a nighttime collision? How do driver fatigue and poorly maintained cars increase the likelihood of an accident? In order to spot trends, such as whether more accidents happen in the summer because of greater travel or in the winter because of snow and ice, the KG can also take seasonal data into account.

This KG is dynamic due to the addition of temporal dimensions, which enable analysis according to time periods (e.g., weekends, vacations, rush hours) or seasonality (e.g., winter accidents versus summer accidents). This time-based analysis aids in determining when preventive actions have to be intensified, such as concentrating on road upkeep prior to winter or stepping up awareness campaigns during the busiest travel times.

This knowledge graph is also special because it can simulate interactions between different road kinds and geographies, such as low-traffic country highways, suburban roadways, and high-density urban areas. Local policy actions can be guided by knowledge of how accidents differ geographically and the reasons that are most common in these places (e.g., speeding in rural areas, distracted driving in urban settings).

Finally, the knowledge graph will assist in locating regions with greater crash rates due to socioeconomic reasons. Lower-income neighbourhoods, for instance, may have poorly maintained roads, inadequate infrastructure for safety, or less accessible driving education programs. It is possible to customise policy recommendations to lessen inequity in road safety by analysing these patterns.

A thorough, scalable, and adaptable method is offered by the knowledge graph, which enables stakeholders to query the data for particular insights. It offers multi-layered, interwoven linkages between different crash-related factors, which sets it unique from standard relational databases. In the end, our method will assist in recognising patterns, projecting future regions of high risk, and providing practical advice for prevention—all the while adjusting to new data sources and use cases.


#  Competency Questions
1. How do the vehicle attributes (such as safety restraints,airbag deployment) and vehicle speed influence the fatality rate among motor vehicle occupants?
2. In what ways do different collision types (e.g., head-on, rear-end) and seat position affect fatality rates?
3. What patterns exist between the time of day, weather conditions,seasons and the likelihood of fatalities in crashes?
4. How do fatality rates for non-occupants (pedestrians, bicyclists) compare to those of vehicle occupants, especially in intersection and hit-and-run incidents?
5. To what extent do EMS response times (from notification to arrival at the crash site and transport to treatment facilities) impact survival outcomes?
6. How does crash locations (intersections, work zones), the type of roadway (highways, residential streets, etc.) and vehicle type (trucks, buses, motorbikes, cars) relate to the fatality risk for crash participants?
7. What is the relationship between driver impairment (alcohol, drugs, fatigue) and crash fatality outcomes?
8. How do injury severity and survival lag time interrelate among crash victims, and how is this affected by factors such as EMS timing and location?
