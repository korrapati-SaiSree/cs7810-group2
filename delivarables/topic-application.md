## Topic 1: Road Crashes
A) **Merit**: Is the topic intellectually challenging?

The merit of having a KG on road crashes begin with addressing the most common causes of accidents such as driver conditions (alchoal usage, tired, distracted), vehicle conditions (faulty brakes, faulty engine, worn tires, broken window), road conditions (poor lighting, sharp curves, potholes), weather conditions (rain, fog, snow, sunny). These factors directly contribute to accidents, and representing them clearly in the knowledge graph provides a data-driven insight into the causes and locations of accidents. This enables authorities to identify high-risk areas more easily and implement timely preventive measures.
However, when we look at how multiple factors combined increases risks, the project becomes more challenging. For instance, how does poor weather and a drowsy driver increase the likelihood of an accident? Or what effect does a poorly designed road have on nighttime drivers? The knowledge graph can be more effective when we add time dimension to it, like how risks differ over the course of a day, week or year. By this analysis we can uncover the hidden patterns.
Last but not the least, what makes this project standout is the addition of less evident factors. Although they are frequently disregarded, factors including inconsistent traffic signage, poor road upkeep, socioeconomic situtions and cell phone distractions all contribute to accidents.
