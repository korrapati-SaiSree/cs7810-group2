# Topic Application

## Topic 1: Road Crashes

A) **Merit**: Is the topic intellectually challenging?

The merit of having a KG on road crashes begin with addressing the most common causes of accidents such as driver conditions (alchoal usage, tired, distracted), vehicle conditions (faulty brakes, faulty engine, worn tires, broken window), road conditions (poor lighting, sharp curves, potholes), weather conditions (rain, fog, snow, sunny). These factors directly contribute to accidents, and representing them clearly in the knowledge graph provides a data-driven insight into the causes and locations of accidents. This enables authorities to identify high-risk areas more easily and implement timely preventive measures.
However, when we look at how multiple factors combined increases risks, the project becomes more challenging. For instance, how does poor weather and a drowsy driver increase the likelihood of an accident? Or what effect does a poorly designed road have on nighttime drivers? The knowledge graph can be more effective when we add time dimension to it, like how risks differ over the course of a day, week or year. By this analysis we can uncover the hidden patterns.
Last but not the least, what makes this project standout is the addition of less evident factors. Although they are frequently disregarded, factors including inconsistent traffic signage, poor road upkeep, socioeconomic situtions and cell phone distractions all contribute to accidents.

B) **Novelty**: is there already a knowledge graph for this topic?

Even though, there are few knowledge graphs on traffic accidents already in existence, most of them concentrate on only the most obvious reasons. What makes this project novel is, we are stressing on combining multiple factors to analyze how they interact and increase accidents. This brings fresh dimension. Also the novelty resides in adding less evident causes - which are frequently missed in current knowldge graphs. Over all, we are trying to fill in the gaps left.

C) **Timeliness**: does creating a knowledge graph for this topic address a current event or important (unsolved) problem?

Yes, this KG can address current problem. Every year, over 1.35 million people are dying in road crashes world wide, and millions more are injured. Even after advancements in road infrastrucutre and vehicle technology, road accidents continue to cause deaths. Traditional approaches to road safety are becoming less effective as they relay on historical data without real-time, integrated insights. A KG that can model crash risks, identifying emerging patterns and predict high risk areas has the potential to save lives.

## Topic 2: Impact of Remote Work on Urban and Suburban Real Estate Markets

- **Merit**: is the topic intellectually challenging?

Remote work and its impacts for real estate markets are an interesting topic since numerous socio-economic factors, work-related changes and geographical factors operate interactively. There enables an opportunity to examine how changes in the employment size in certain industries relate to the demand for new space in urban and suburban regions. For instance, the development of remote working decreases the requirement of the offices in specific central business districts implying a rise in the real estate in suburban areas as people look for large houses for home offices. However, the challenge arises in relating these trends to firms, sizes, changes in payroll, and changes in employment; especially by establishment size (for instance, firms with less than 500 employees and the ones with more than 500 employees). A vast quantity of high-quality evidence points to the fact that employment and firm size and its interplay matter for real estate across the regions; the analysis of such relationships means having to contend with various economic indicators and their effects. However, incorporating time variation to compare pre-pandemic and post-pandemic demand patterns and controls for firm size and firm industry simply makes this analysis more challenging and stimulating.

- **Novelty**: is there already a knowledge graph for this topic?

Although there are several theoretical analyses of how remote work affects real estate, most investigations relate to issues like urbanization shift to suburbs, or office space. There is little research that addresses these effects on a disaggregate level of firm size, payroll, and industry type as exemplified by this dataset. This project contributes a new perspective by analyzing how industries firm size affect markets for real estate in the urban and suburban regions. Furthermore, detailed employment and payroll data may help to identify organized sectors or sizes of firms that are leading changes in real estate demands; information not normally included in other studies.

- **Timeliness**: does creating a knowledge graph for this topic address a current event or important (unsolved) problem?

Yes, indeed, this topic concerns one of the most urgent problems. The challenges of COVID-19 have caused shifts in the trends of remote working, which have affected the supply and demand of real estate in the US. Its consequences are still felt to this date and most areas are struggling to overcome some of the effects of decrease in office space, rise in demand for suburban homes and changes in property prices. It can also offer insights into which industries and firm sizes are driving these trends, and help policymakers, real estate developers, and firms adjust to continuous changes in the market.
